## About <a name = "about"></a>

For each data source, the pipeline creates a set of edges and/or nodes between a selection of data types. 

An edge dataframe consists of the following columns: 

|Column | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
|from_type | string | the type of the source node|
|from_value | string | the value of the source node|
|to_type | string | the type of the target node|
|to_value | string | the value of the target node|
|label| string | the relationship of the edge|
|source|string | the source of the dataset|
|parameters| dictionary\[lists\] | a collection of lists of additional parameters for each edge|

<br>

A node dataframe consists of the following columns:

|Column | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
|node_type | string | the type of the node|
|value | string | the value of the node|
|parameters| dictionary\[lists\] | a collection of lists of additional parameters for each node|

The valid node types and sources are located in the [formatting_config.yaml](src/config/formatting_config.yaml) file. To add additional valid inputs, just add to that file - the data will be validated during the formatting step.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.



### Prerequisites
To run the docker container, you'll need [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your machine.


### Installing
Everything you need to run can be installed using the Dockerfile:


Clone the repository to a local folder and enter the root directory

```
git clone https://github.com/alb202/drug_annotations.git
cd drug_annotations
```

Build the docker container

```
docker build -t drug_annotations .
```

Launch the container. It is currently set to run on 'localhost', and the command will map the Dagit port 3000 to your port 3000. You'll also need to set a local folder as a volume to access the results of the pipeline.

```
docker run -dp 3000:3000 -v <local folder>:/opt/dagster/app/data drug_annotations
```
The local folder can be any empty, writable location. On Windows, try '%cd%/data'. On linux, try '$(pwd)/data'

Go to the address below and start the pipeline from the Dagit interface

```
localhost:3000
```

The output of the pipeline will appear in the folder mounted during the docker run command


Additionally, you can use Docker compose to run the pipeline with a Docker postgres database container. After creating the drug_annotations container, run docker compose: 
```
docker compose up -d
```


Additionally, you can use Docker compose to run the pipeline with a Docker postgres database container. After creating the drug_annotations container, run docker compose: 
```
docker compose up -d
```

You can also run the dagster pipeline directly from the 'drug_annotations' folder. Simpy run:
```
python __main__.py
```

## TODO <a name = "todo"></a>
Check back as more resources are added to the pipeline and the knowledge graph itself is completed
